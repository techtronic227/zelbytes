# FINAL REPORT

# Automated Grow-Bench Prototype

## 1. Introduction

The Automated Grow-Bench Prototype is an Arduino Uno-based smart irrigation system designed to automate plant watering using soil moisture measurements. The system continuously monitors soil moisture and automatically activates a relay-controlled pump whenever the soil becomes dry. Manual override and serial commands provide additional control and flexibility. The project demonstrates the application of embedded systems in smart agriculture and efficient water management.

# 6. Working Principle

The soil moisture sensor continuously measures the moisture content of the soil. The Arduino Uno reads the analog value from the sensor through pin A0. If the moisture level exceeds the threshold value, indicating dry soil, the relay connected to pin D7 turns ON the water pump. Once sufficient moisture is achieved, the relay turns OFF the pump.

A push button connected to D2 enables manual override. The user can also control the system using serial commands through the Serial Monitor.

---

# 7. Serial Commands

### STATUS

Displays:

* Current mode
* Soil moisture reading
* Threshold value
* Pump state

### FORCE_ON

Forces the pump to turn ON.

### FORCE_OFF

Forces the pump to turn OFF.

---

# 8. Calibration Methodology

The soil moisture sensor was calibrated under dry and wet conditions.

### Dry Soil

Typical readings:

600 – 900

### Wet Soil

Typical readings:

200 – 500

Based on experimental observations, a threshold value of 600 was selected.
